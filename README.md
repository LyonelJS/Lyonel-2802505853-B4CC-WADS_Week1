# How Node.js Works: A Comprehensive Guide
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. It allows developers to use JavaScript to write command-line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.

Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, the same engine that powers Google Chrome. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.
