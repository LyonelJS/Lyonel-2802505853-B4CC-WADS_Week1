### The Event Loop
The heart of Node.js is the Event Loop. Unlike traditional web servers that create a new thread for every request, Node.js operates on a single thread, using non-blocking I/O calls. This allows it to support tens of thousands of concurrent connections without incurring the cost of thread context switching.
